# Privacy Policy for Ai CV Builder

**Effective Date:** 24 February 2026

InfinityMmedia ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application and web platform (the "Ai CV Builder" or "App"). 

Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

## 1. Information We Collect (Or Don't Collect)

Our core philosophy is **Local-First Privacy**. We believe your professional resume data belongs to you.

### A. Your CV Data is Saved Locally
We **do not** collect, store, or transmit your personal CV information (such as your name, contact details, work experience, or education) to any database owned by us. 
- All data you type into the application is saved locally on your device's browser/storage (`LocalStorage`). 
- There are no mandatory user accounts required to use the standard features of the App.

### B. Automatically Collected Information
When you access the App, certain third-party services we use may automatically collect non-personal device information:
- **Device Data:** Device type, operating system, unique device identifiers.
- **Usage Data:** Anonymous interaction events to help us improve the App's UI/UX.

### C. Third-Party Data Collection & Integrations
Our application integrates with third-party software development kits (SDKs) to provide functionality and display advertisements:
- **Google AdMob:** We display advertisements via Google AdMob on mobile devices. AdMob may collect and process certain device data and ad interaction data to provide relevant ads. We encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy regarding personalized advertising.
- **Google Gemini & OpenAI:** If you use our AI features (e.g., PDF parsing, text translation, or cover letter generation), the specific text you submit is sent securely to these APIs for processing. This data is transmitted statelessly via secure Edge Functions. We do not store this data, nor is your data used by OpenAI or Google to train their foundation AI models.

---

## 2. How We Use the Information
Because your CV data remains on your local device, we do not use your personal information. 
The automated data collected by our third-party SDKs (like AdMob) is used to:
- Deliver targeted advertising to keep the app free.
- Provide, operate, and maintain the App's core functionality.

---

## 3. Disclosure of Information
We **do not sell** your personal data to anyone, because we do not collect or possess it. 

Data transmitted for AI processing (to Google and OpenAI) is strictly for the fulfillment of the user's request and is governed by strict enterprise data privacy rules preventing training on user API inputs.

---

## 4. Policy for Children
We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you believe a child under 13 has inadvertently provided personal information to third-party SDKs in our app, please contact us.

---

## 5. Your Data Rights
Because all of your generated CV data is stored locally on your own device, you have complete control over it. 
- **Deletion:** You can permanently delete your data at any time by clearing your browser/app data or pressing the "Reset/Clear Data" buttons within the App. This destroys the data immediately as it exists nowhere else.

---

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
